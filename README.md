# About Me

You can learn more about me at [my website (lyte.dev)](https://lyte.dev).

# Where are your projects?

My GitHub is largely unused except to host projects that I actually want to be found or searched for.

All the more-recent, interesting, random projects and experiments are found at [my own git forge (git.lyte.dev/lytedev)](https://git.lyte.dev/lytedev).

❤️
